# UAE API Automation Test Suite

This repository contains automated tests for validating various UAE government APIs, including:

- OAuth2 Token Authentication
- Trade License Extraction (Ajman, UAQ, Ras Al Khaimah)
- TRN (Tax Registration Number) Lookup

The test suite is built using `pytest` and supports HTML and Allure reports for detailed insights.

```bash
pytest tests/test_trade_license.py
```

---

## 🧪 Sample Tests Included

* ✅ `POST /api/oauth2/token` — Token validation with positive & negative scenarios
* ✅ `POST /api/trade-license/extract` — Trade license extraction for Ajman, UAQ, and RAK
* ✅ `POST /api/trn/search` — Lookup by TRN with expected company name

## ❗ Troubleshooting

| Issue                    | Fix                                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `0 test cases` in Allure | Run pytest with `--alluredir=allure-results`    |
| `allure` not found       | Ensure Allure CLI is installed & in system PATH |
| HTML report not styled   | Use `--self-contained-html` flag                |
